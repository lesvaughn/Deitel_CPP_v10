a)	The function prototype for float denotes a float will be return as a result of the function
	call.  Howerver, the actual function definition does not define a return value. Therefore,
	the function definition should be as follows:

		float cube(float number) {
			return number * number * number;
		}

b)	srand seeds the random number generator.  srand should be on its own line as a statement
	containing a seed value.  

	The seed value could be provided by input from the user:
		srand(seed_value_input_by_user);

	Or the seed value could be the current time as follows:
		srand(static_cast<unsigned_int>(ctime(0)));

c)	As x is an integer, setting x to the float value of y will cause precision loss resulting
	in the decimal portion to y being lost.  static_cast<float>(x) will still result in the
	decimal portion lost.  Assuming the author wanted to cast the float to an int, the following
	could have been written:

		cout <<static_cast<int>(y);

d)	The function's arguments for 'a' an 'b' are overwritten and initialized to zero.  The function
	will always return zero. To fix, this issue, the twoe statements which initialize 'a' and 'b' 
	to zero should be eliminated;

e) The recursive function does not decrement the value of n.  Therefore, 'n' will not reach
	the value of zero and thus terminate.  The fix is as follows:

		return n + sum(n - 1);
