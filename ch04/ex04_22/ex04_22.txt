Note my edition of the book my have had a typo.
Line 9 did not conclude with a "{'.

If intentional, the program will would not print anythng as a compile
error would occur.  If the author intended for line 9 to conclude with
an opening "{", the program would then print:

#@@#@@
#@@#@@
#@@#@@
<-----><-----><-----><----->
#@@#@@
#@@#@@
#@@#@@
<-----><-----><-----><----->
